##Linear Algebra
#Vector: Think of it as an arrow rooted in the origin
#Vector is a flow of movements, so sum of vectors are done with same components such as x or y
#So, multiplying number to a vector is done with each components of a vector such as x or y

#Scaling is multiplying number with vector. Basically number lengthens or shortens vectors.

##Day 2
#We can think of "a vector" as "the sum of two unit vectors" that are scalared by numbers.
#unit vector is an object which is scalared by a number.

#Despite seemingly same vectors, they are different to each other if their unit vectors are different.
#(look at the note page with a star mark 1)

#if I set a linear combination as "ax+by"(a,b are real numbers and x,y are vectors in a two-dimentional plane),
#its span is a set of all its linear combination.

#Changing the number of a and b, the combination can represents every vector in a two-dimentional plane
#therefore, the span of x and y is a two-dimentional plane, every spots in the plane.


#think of three dimentions, if the third vector is located in the span of a1+b2(1,2 are vectors in three dimentions), the span does not change.
#This is called "linear dependent"

#However, if the third one is not in the span, the whole span of a1+b2+c3 would indicate all 3 dimentions.
#if every single vector contributes to the enlargement of the span, we can call it as "linear independent"
